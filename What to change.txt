🎯 EXAM QUICK REFERENCE — What To Change

TASK 1: RAG PIPELINE
ingest.py (Run FIRST)
DATA_DIR = 'data'              ← Folder with .txt files
EMBEDDING_MODEL = 'nomic-embed-text'  ← Or 'llama3.1'
CHUNK_SIZE = 2000              ← Characters per chunk
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 50             ← Overlap between chunks
rag_chain.py (Run SECOND)
EMBEDDING_MODEL = '...'        ← MUST MATCH ingest.py!
LLM_MODEL = 'llama3.1'         ← Model for answers
NUM_RESULTS = 3                ← How many chunks to find
question = "..."               ← YOUR QUESTION HERE
⚠️ IMPORTANT: EMBEDDING_MODEL must be SAME in both files!

TASK 2: BLIP
blip_caption.py
IMAGE_PATH = r"images/test.jpg"    ← YOUR IMAGE PATH
TEXT_PROMPT = "a photo of"         ← For conditional caption
QUESTION = "What is in the image?" ← For Q&A

NOTHING ELSE CHANGES!
All imports, functions, logic — keep exactly as is.

EXAM STEPS
RAG:

Put .txt files in data/ folder
Run python ingest.py
Change question in rag_chain.py
Run python rag_chain.py

BLIP:

Change IMAGE_PATH to your image
Run python blip_caption.py


COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
❌ Don't name file ollama.py
❌ Don't forget to run ollama serve
❌ Don't use different EMBEDDING_MODEL in two files
❌ Don't forget r"" for Windows paths
